# Unsupervised_Learning

In this project, I am going to make my project-based learning projects on unsupervised learning. Currently, there is only one file, `dim_red.ipynb`, where I have used multiple dimensionality reduction techniques on the MNIST dataset.

## Dimensionality Reduction Techniques Used

1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
2. **Sparse PCA**
3. **Single Value Decomposition (SVD)**
4. **Gaussian Random Projection**
5. **Sparse Random Projection**
6. **Isomap**
7. **Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS)**
8. **Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)**
9. **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**
10. **Independent Component Analysis (ICA)**

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset is used for demonstrating the dimensionality reduction techniques.

## File Structure

- `dim_red.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of various dimensionality reduction techniques on the MNIST dataset.
